# Linked List in Java

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a **singly linked list** in Java using generics. It includes features like adding/removing from head and tail, deleting specific items, checking contents, and printing the list.

---

## Files Included

- `Node.java` – Defines a generic node with `item` and `next` pointer.
- `LinkedListInterface.java` – Interface with linked list method definitions.
- `LinkedList.java` – Core logic for a generic singly linked list.
- `Candy.java` – Sample object class to test the list with non-primitive data.
- `CandyMain1.java` – A simple program that tests all linked list operations.

## Key Features

- `newHead(item)` – Add a new item at the beginning of the list
- `deleteHead()` – Remove the first item from the list
- `newTail(item)` – Add a new item at the end of the list
- `deleteTail()` – Remove the last item from the list
- `deleteItem(item)` – Remove a specific item from anywhere in the list
- `contains(item)` – Check if the list contains an item
- `clear()` – Remove all items from the list
- `size()` – Return the number of items in the list
- `isEmpty()` – Check if the list is empty
- `print()` – Print the entire list from head to tail
